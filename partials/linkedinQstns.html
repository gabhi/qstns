<li>Given two (dictionary) words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two words are called isomorphic <br /> if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. Remapping a letter means replacing all <br /> occurrences of it with another letter while the ordering of the letters remains unchanged. No two letters <br /> may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> given &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;app&quot;; returns true <br /> we can map 'f' -&gt; 'a' and 'o' -&gt; 'p' <br /> given &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;; returns false <br /> we can't map both 'a' and 'r' to 'o' <br /> <br /> given &quot;turtle&quot;, &quot;tletur&quot;; returns true <br /> we can map 't' -&gt; 't', 'u' -&gt; 'l', 'r' -&gt; 'e', 'l' -&gt; 'u', 'e' -'r' <br /> <br /> given &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;; returns true <br /> we can map 'a' -&gt; 'c', 'b'<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>You have two arrays of integers, where the integers do not repeat and the two arrays have no common integers. <br /> <br />Let x be any integer in the first array, y any integer in the second. Find min(Abs(x-y)). That is, find the smallest difference between any of the integers in the two arrays. <br /> <br />Assumptions: Assume both arrays are sorted in ascending order.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Maximum value Continuous Subsequence: <br />Given array A[n] find continuous subsequence a[i]..a[j] for which sum of elements in the subsequence is maximum. <br /> <br />Ex: {-2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2} --&gt; 11 - 4 +13 = 20 <br /> {1, -3, 4, -2, -1, 6} --&gt; 4 -2 -1 +6 = 7 <br /> <br />Time complexity should O(nlogn)<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Given a sorted integer array and a number, find the start and end indexes of the number in the array. <br /> <br />Ex1: Array = {0,0,2,3,3,3,3,4,7,7,9} and Number = 3 --&gt; Output = {3,6} <br />Ex2: Array = {0,0,2,3,3,3,3,4,7,7,9} and Number = 5 --&gt; Output = {-1,-1} <br /> <br />Complexity should be less than O(n)<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Implement DFS for binary tree<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>There are 2 sorted sets.Find the common elements of those sets <br />e.g. <br />A={1,2,3,4,5,6} <br />B={5,6,7,8,9} <br />o/p C={5,6} <br /> <br />Complexity should ne 0(n+m) where n and m is the size of the first and second set respectively <br /> <br />Which data structure should be used to store the output<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A. <br />Write a function <br />int arrLeader(int A[], int N); <br />that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the leader of array A. The function should return ?1 if array A does not contain a leader. <br />Assume that: <br />N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000]; <br />each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2147483647]. <br />For example, given array A consisting of ten elements such that: <br />A[0] = 4 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 2 <br />A[3] = 3 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 4 <br />A[6] = 2 A[7] = 2 A[8] = 6 <br />A[9] = 4 <br />the function should return ?1, because the value that occurs most frequently in the array, 2, occurs 5 times, and 5 is not more than half of 10. <br />Given array A consisting of five elements such that: <br />A[0] = 100 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 1 <br />A[3] = 50 A[4] = 1 <br />the function should return 1. <br />Complexity: <br />expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); <br />expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). <br />Elements of input arrays can be modified.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Write a multithreaded blocking version of Bounded Queue. <br />There are writers which fill up the queue, and then readers which empty the queue. <br />If q is full, writer should block. If Q is empty readers should block. <br />The Queue size is finite... (its bounded). <br />Maximize parallelism, minimize resource usage etc...<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Consider this string representation for binary trees. Each node is of the form (lr), where l represents the left child and r represents the right child. If l is the character 0, then there is no left child. Similarly, if r is the character 0, then there is no right child. Otherwise, the child can be a node of the form (lr), and the representation continues recursively. <br />For example: (00) is a tree that consists of one node. ((00)0) is a two-node tree in which the root has a left child, and the left child is a leaf. And ((00)(00)) is a three-node tree, with a root, a left and a right child. <br /> <br />Write a function that takes as input such a string, and returns -1 if the string is malformed, and the depth of the tree if the string is well-formed. <br /> <br />For instance: <br /> <br /> find_depth('(00)') -&gt; 0 <br /> find_depth('((00)0)') -&gt; 1 <br /> find_depth('((00)(00))') -&gt; 1 <br /> find_depth('((00)(0(00)))') -&gt; 2 <br /> find_depth('((00)(0(0(00))))') -&gt; 3 <br /> find_depth('x') -&gt; -1 <br /> find_depth('0') -&gt; -1 <br /> find_depth('()') -&gt; -1 <br /> find_depth('(0)') -&gt; -1 <br /> find_depth('(00)x') -&gt; -1 <br /> find_depth('(0p)') -&gt; -1<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Find and store all the valid numbers in an array that are in the string including negative, positive, hexadecimal, octal, binary? <br /> <br />For example string &quot;abcd 0xa 11.12 123&quot; has values 10, 11.12 , 123. <br /> <br />I would rephrase the question: find all words(separated from other words through tabs or spaces) in the string that can be expressed in the form of decimal number.

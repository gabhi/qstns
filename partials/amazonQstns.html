<li>The amount of Magical Aura is calculated in terms of &quot;Mana Points&quot;. <br />On entering the forest he sees 'n' number of portals in front of him numbered from '0' to 'n-1' arranged in a straight line. <br />Each portal has a value written over it. He sees that the first and the last portals are damaged and cannot be activated (remain unactivated). <br /> <br />He can perform the following operations repeatedly to gain Magical Aura : <br /> 1. He can activate a portal 'x' (obviously not the first and the last one). <br /> 2. Let 'l' be the nearest unactivated portal to the left of 'x' and 'r' be the nearest unactivated portal to the right of 'x'. <br /> 3. On activating the portal 'x' he gains Mana points equal to the product of value of written over 'l' and the value written over 'r'. <br /> 4. A portal once activated cannot be activated again. <br /> <br />He stops when the above process cannot be continued anymore. <br />Note that 'nearest' is with respect to the portal currently being activated. <br /> <br />Now Sherlock is thinking what is the maximum amount of Magical Aura (Mana points) he can gain in this process. <br />Help him find this. <br /> <br />Input : <br />First line contains no of testcases 't'. <br />Next 't' testcases follow, first line of each is an integer 'n', representing number of portals inside the forest. <br />Next line contains 'n' space seperated integers which are the values written over the corresponding n portals. <br /> <br />Ouptut : <br />Output 'n' lines each having one integer denoting the maximum amount of Mana points he can gain for that particular testcase. <br /> <br />Constraints : <br />1 &lt;= t &lt;= 500 <br />3 &lt;= n &lt;= 80 <br />1 &lt;= Value written over each portal &lt;= 1000 <br /> <br />Sample Input : <br />1 <br />4 <br />1 2 3 4 <br /> <br />Sample Output : <br />12 <br /> <br />Explanation : <br />We have only 2 choices : <br />1. Activate portal numbered 1 first, and portal numbered 2 next. The total Mana points are 1 * 3 + 1 * 4 = 7. <br />2. Activate portal numbered 2 first, and portal numbered 1 next. The total Mana points are 2 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12. <br /> <br />So the answer is 12.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous part of S. A suffix of the string S is any trailing contiguous part of S. For example, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;cod&quot; are prefixes, and &quot;ty&quot; and &quot;ity&quot; are suffixes of the string &quot;codility&quot;. For simplicity, we require prefixes and suffixes to be non-empty and shorter than the whole string S. <br />A border of a string S is any string that is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, &quot;cut&quot; is a border of a string &quot;cutletcut&quot;, and a string &quot;barbararhubarb&quot; has two borders: &quot;b&quot; and &quot;barb&quot;. <br />We are looking for such borders of S that have at least three non-overlapping occurrences; that is, for some string that occurs as a prefix, as a suffix and elsewhere in between. For example, for S = &quot;barbararhubarb&quot;, the only such string is &quot;b&quot;. <br />In this problem we consider only strings that consist of lower-case English letters (a?z). <br />Write a function:
<code></code>

that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of its longest border that has at least three non-overlapping occurrences in the given string. If there is no such border in S, the function should return 0. <br />For example, given a string S as follows: <br />if S = &quot;barbararhubarb&quot; the function should return 1, as explained above; <br />if S = &quot;ababab&quot; the function should return 2, as &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;abab&quot; are both borders of S, but only &quot;ab&quot; has three non-overlapping occurrences; <br />if S = &quot;baaab&quot; the function should return 0, as its only border &quot;b&quot; occurs only twice. <br />Assume that: <br />N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000]; <br />string S consists only of lower-case letters (a?z). <br />Complexity: <br />expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); <br />expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).<span class="chevron"></span></li>

Q1: How do you make it thread safe? <br />I said use “public void synchronized” Good. But terrible performance since the entire method is synchronized. <br /> <br />Q2: Can you not lock on the entire method? I said used nested locks:
<code></code>

His q: This will lead to a deadlock if in another thread I call Transfer (id2, id1) and Transfer (id1, id2).
<code></code>

<code></code>

How do you prevent this then? How do you design your code to not to get in to deadlock? (stumbled here)<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>How do you detect deadlocks? What tools would you use? I said do “Kill -3 .&lt;process id&gt;, and analyse if anything is deadlocked.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>3) Coding question:
<code></code>

Will the thread spawned will ever see the flagRun=false? <br /> <br />My corrected answer after a couple of attempts: No, since each thread will get a copy of it’s own flagRun, changing the flagRun value in the main thread will not be seen in the spawned thread. <br /> <br />How to fix it: declare flagRun to be volatile so that the values can be changed and seen in either threads.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Puzzle: There are 5 slots(1,2,3,4,5) and 5 people(A,B,C,D,E). Each of them provide their preferences. A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, C=4. Given an arbitary starting sequence say BCDEA, going clock wise: how many passes does it take to fill in those slots so that max number of people are happy. People are happy if A gets 1, B gets 2, C gets 3, etc. Remember D and E cannot be kept happy together at the same time because both of them prefer Slot-4. <br /> <br />My answer: Worst case scenario when you start at BCDEA(only E is happy because E comes in 4th position and prefers 4), next rotation pass CDEAB(no one is happy), DEABC(no one), EABCD(no one), ABCDE(4 people are happy). So for N people, it takes N passes. <br /> <br />His question: Can you do better than N passes? (Can you do this in less than N passes?) <br /> <br /> (I tried to come up with something but stumbled.)<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Each time a visitor requests a page from our website, our webserver writes a log entry recoding the visitor's identity and the kind of page requested. Entries are written in chronological order to a plain-text file, with one entry per line. The format of each entry is: <br /> <br /> user-id page-type-id <br /> <br />User IDs are arbitrary strings that uniquely represent a given user; if a user visits multiple pages, each log entry will have the same user ID. Page type IDs are arbitrary strings that uniquely represent a given kind of page on our site, such as the homepage, a product detail pages, or the shopping cart. Tons of users visit our website, but there are only a few dozen types of pages. <br /> <br />We can use our weblogs to answer questions about user behavior. One interesting question is: what is the most common three page sequence through the site? E.g., if the most common pattern is to buy items advertised on the home page of the site, we might see the most common three page sequence as &quot;Homepage -&gt; ProductDetailPage -&gt; ShoppingCart&quot;. However, if customers spend a lot of time browsing the &quot;Customers who bought this item also bought&quot; feature, we might see the most common three page sequence as &quot;ProductDetailPage -&gt; ProductDetailPage -&gt; ProductDetailPage&quot;. <br /> <br />Attached is a sample log file for your reference. Within the first 10 lines of the sample, customer &quot;234&quot; travels through the sequences &quot;Listmania -&gt; ProductDetail -&gt; Checkout&quot; and &quot;ProductDetail -&gt; Checkout -&gt; HomePage&quot; once each. <br /> <br />For the sake of this test feel free to assume that everything will fit in memory. Do keep in mind that given the size of our data sets, performance has to be considered, also, we will be looking at more than just correct output..<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>There is an old dry well. Its sides are made of concrete rings. Each such ring is one meter high, but the rings can have different (internal) diameters. Nevertheless, all the rings are centered on one another. The well is N meters deep; that is, there are N concrete rings inside it. <br />You are about to drop M concrete disks into the well. Each disk is one meter thick, and different disks can have different diameters. Once each disk is dropped, it falls down until: * it hits the bottom of the well; * it hits a ring whose internal diameter is smaller then the disk's diameter; or * it hits a previously dropped disk. (Note that if the internal diameter of a ring and the diameter of a disk are equal, then the disk can fall through the ring.) <br />The disks you are about to drop are ready and you know their diameters, as well as the diameters of all the rings in the well. The question arises: how many of the disks will fit into the well? <br />Write a function: <br />class Solution { int falling_disks(int[] A,int[] B); } <br />that, given two zero-indexed arrays of integers ? A, containing the internal diameters of the N rings (in top-down order), and B, containing the diameters of the M disks (in the order they are to be dropped) ? returns the number of disks that will fit into the well. <br />For example, given the following two arrays: <br /> A[0] = 5 B[0] = 2 <br /> A[1] = 6 B[1] = 3 <br /> A[2] = 4 B[2] = 5 <br /> A[3] = 3 B[3] = 2 <br /> A[4] = 6 B[4] = 4 <br /> A[5] = 2 <br /> A[6] = 3 <br />the function should return 4, as all but the last of the disks will fit into the well. The figure shows the situation after dropping four disks. <br /> <br />Assume that: <br />N is an integer within the range [1..200,000]; <br />M is an integer within the range [1..200,000]; <br />each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]; <br />each element of array B is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]. <br />Complexity: <br />expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); <br />expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). <br />Elements of input arrays can be modified.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Given a ternary string, you have to count the total number of contiguous substrings (contigious set of characters), that you can form from this given string such that they comprise of either only one or two different characters. <br /> <br />Please note that a unique substring will be decided by its starting and ending indices. So, a substring 'ab' with starting and ending indices being 1 and 2 respectively should be considered different from a substring 'ab' with starting or ending indices (or both) other than 1 and 2 respectively. <br /> <br />For example: <br /> <br />input ternary string - aabc <br />output - 8 <br />The above string comprises of the following substrings that have either one or two of the characters - a, a, b, c, aa, ab, bc and aab. So the final answer is a total of eight substrings. <br /> <br />input ternary string - abc <br />output - 5 <br />The above string comprises of the following substrings that have either one or two of the characters - a, b, c, ab and bc. So the final answer is a total of five substrings. <br />input ternary string - baaccb <br />output - 16 <br />The above string comprises of the following substrings that have either one or two of the characters - b, a, a, c, c, b, aa, cc, ba, ac, cb, baa, aac, acc, ccb and aacc.

<li>Given an arrangement of balls on 2-D Euclidean plane (i.e a flat surface), you have to assign a color to each ball <br />such that no two adjacent balls are of the same color. A greedy approach can be used to reduce the number of <br />colors required. <br />Question: <br />Model this as a graph problem. [Hint: Balls become vertices, adjacency relation is modeled by edges, and each <br />vertex has a unique identification number and a color.]. Write a program that finds the number of colors <br />required and outputs the balls (unique ids) along with their colors.. Note that to solve this problem, all balls and <br />their neighbors must be inspected. <br />Use adjacency lists to represent the graph. <br />The input to this program is a file containing the number of balls in the first line followed by the list of <br />adjacencies – one per line: e.g. an input line containing <br />x,y <br />denotes that balls x and y are neighbors. Here x and y denote the unique ids of the two balls. <br />A simple greedy algorithm for this color assignment problem is as follows: <br />I. Sort all the vertices in the graph on the basis of their degrees [This sorting should be done in-place on <br />the array of adjacency lists.]. Assume colors are ordered c1, c2, … <br />II. Let u be the un-colored vertex with the smallest degree. [Break ties in favor of the vertex with the <br />smaller id] <br />a. Assign first color ci in the list of colors to u such that <br />color(u) ? ci where ci != color(vj ) for any vertex vj in the adjacency list of u. <br />III. Repeat step II until all vertices are colored. <br />Implement your solution using a Graph ADT that supports the following interfaces: <br />a) Graph createGraph() : Creates an empty graph. <br />b) Graph addEdge(Graph g, Vertex v1, Vertex v2): adds an edge from vertex v1 to vertex v2 to the graph g. <br />If a new vertex is found, then an entry has to be added in the adjacency list <br />c) Iterator getNeighbors(Graph, Vertex): gets a list of neighbors of the vertex. <br />d) Graph sortGraphbyDegree(Graph) : sorts the adjacency list based on degree of the vertices. The vertex <br />with smallest degree will appear first, and the vertex with the largest degree will appear last. If two <br />vertices are having the same degree, then their order of appearance will not change. <br />e) Color chooseColor(Graph, Vertex): returns the first color in the list of colors that satisfies the condition <br />mentioned in step (2) above. <br />f) int assignColors(Graph) : invokes chooseColor vertex by vertex and stores the chosen color in the <br />corresponding vertex. This function returns the number of colors used. <br />g) printGraph(Graph , num_colors_used, file) : prints the number of colors used, num_colors_used, in the <br />first line of the output file. It then prints the graph into the file using the following format: <br />(vertexid,color):v1,v2,v3,vn <br />where vertexid is the unique id of the vertex, color is the color assigned to the vertex, and v1,v2,…,vn <br />correspond the unique identification numbers of the vertices that are adjacent to the current vertex. <br />Data structures Used: <br />Graph: This is a dynamic array, such that each entry in the array contains a pointer to vertex vi, the degree of vi <br />and a list of neighbors of vi. <br />Vertex: Each vertex contains the unique identification number of the vertex, its color. <br />List: This is for the list of neighbors, such that each entry in the list corresponding to vertex vi consists of a <br />pointer to vertex vj, ? vj &Icirc; neighborhood(vi) <br />Steps to perform: <br />1. Write the relevant Header files for an adjacency list representation of Graph <br />2. Write a driver file that reads an input file containing the edges in the graph and prints the graph after <br />coloring the balls. This driver uses the adjacency list for graph representation. <br />a. The driver takes the name of the input file and output file as command line parameters. <br />b. From the file, find number of nodes involved. <br />c. For each line in the input file corresponding to an edge <br />i. add the edge using call to addEdge(). <br />d. The driver must then invoke function sortGraphbyDegree() to sort the vertices in the increasing <br />order of their degrees. <br />e. Invoke assignColors to assign colours to each vertex. <br />f. Print the number of colours used and the resultant graph into the output file using the call to <br />the function printGraph(). If no output file is mentioned in the command-line, then print the <br />graph into the screen. <br />3. Write the code for the functions a - g<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Given a stack. <br />Can we find range of numbers in the stack ? <br />Range is Max value in stack - Min value in stack. <br />Q &gt; How will we design the stack to get Range in O(1) ? <br /> <br />Ans &gt; I answered this one saying we have max variable and min variable defined in the stack. Whenever we push any number into stack, we compare with the current max and update, if necessary. Same with min. <br /> <br />Q &gt; Then, he asked me what happens when we pop ? <br />If the element to be popped is the max element, how do we find the second max to be the new max element. <br /> <br />Ans &gt; This, i answered we maintain two different stacks inside a stack called maxStack and minStack for max and min elements. He asked me to code everything. I did. <br /> <br />Then, he asked me if there are duplicates in the stack, can we optimise our solution so that the max element doesn't get inserted into the maxStack more than once and still we get all the above functionalities in optimised way ? <br /> <br />Ans &gt; I answered we maintain a map of integer and it count. When we push into the stack, if the element is already there in the stack, we increase its count and update the maxStack or minStack, if necessary. When we pop, we decrease the count. If count becomes 0, then we update the maxStack and minStack, if necessary. <br /> <br />I coded everything then.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>I was given a very interesting question. <br />You are given two very large files each containing integers in each line followed by a line break. <br /> <br />Produce a file with integers that are common in both files. <br /> <br />Estimate the time complexity of your code block? <br /> <br />Any edge cases and Bottlenecks? <br /> <br />Assumptions? <br />How would you solve this. <br /> <br />I did a little research on this and saw that some people suggested using Radix Sort for this and trying to split on large file into subsets and then using radix sort. <br /> <br />Here is the link <br /> <br />http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6520954/produce-a-file-that-has-integers-common-to-two-large-files-containing-integers <br /> <br />Can someone help me write this function. I read a lot of theories a lot of places but I am really looking for a code, preferably java for this. <br /> <br />This is a simple implementation of the same. I got a clarification that numbers are integers but the files are large but on one disk only. <br /> <br />I am using an approach as In case the file is too big to fit into memory on one go, break it into parts or read n integers at a time.and then use hashmaps to look for integers. <br /> <br />Cpmplexity: If the partition size is p and the file size is m then and no of rows per partition in n then ----- O(m/p * n) or O(N).

<li>Im sure everyones heard of this. <br />Matrix with rows and column sorted. Find a particular element. <br />I mentioned the O(m+n) solution. He asked to make it better. <br /> <br />Thought for a while, then told him that you start with the last element of the first row and once you find the row which might contain the element, do a binary search on that row (since its sorted). <br />This further brings down the complexity to O(m+logn). <br />He said make it even better. <br /> <br />So I said do a binary search on the last column and look for the row where the element in the previous row is smaller and the element in the current row is greater than or equal to the target. <br />So the complexity becomes O(log m + log n). <br />He said ok. <br /> <br />When I was about to code this, he said there are two ways to implement it. <br />1) One you implement the dual binary search method. <br />2) Make use of the facts that the rows and columns are sorted. <br /> <br />Thought this over for a while and mentioned that instead of doing two binary searches, you can do just one considering the entire matrix as a linear array and doing binary search. <br />The complexity would be log(m*n)=log(m) + log(n).(Same as the previous optimal solution). <br />There would be some logic involved in translating the indices to (row,col) pairs. I got this working, but he wanted me to return the (row,col) pair if the element was found or (-1,-1) if not found. <br /> <br />For this he gave me the function signature <br /> <br />void find(int A[][10], int m, int n, int target,int&amp;row, int col) <br /> <br />which is what I couldn't figure out. Here m = number of rows and n=no of cols <br /> <br />Here is the solution I gave

<li>Given a robot and a Maze in a game. Following our few of the primitives: <br />bool IsMazeExit(); <br />bool Forward(); <br />void RightTurn(); <br />Constraints: <br />Every room in the maze is a square. Each room has 2 doors. Robot can call IsExitMaze() when in a room and identify the exit. Forward moves the Robot forward few steps and if it finds a wall it returns to its position. Right turn turns the robot right 90 degrees. <br />Write a method to find the exit<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>You are given a function printKDistanceNodes which takes in a root node of a binary tree, a start node and an integer K. Complete the function to print the value of all the nodes (one-per-line) which are a K distance from the given start node in sorted order. Distance can be upwards or downwards.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Get the top 3 frequently used words in a book. The book contents are given as a single text file. <br />I used hashmap solution. The interviewer said its not optimal. Use a combination of two or three data struct.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>You have given two polynomials .. You have to choose a data structure which will be used for addition of both polynomials :- <br />Condition :- <br />polynomials are very huge ..(n is very big) <br />a + bx +cx2 +...... +nxn .. <br />c + dx +ex2+...... +nxn .. <br />you have to store the polynomial after sum .<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Write function compress(char* strSource) <br />it should do the following . <br />repeating chars in sequence should be replaced with char &amp; count, in case count is 1 no need to add any integer. <br />Example - AAAABBBCXYZEEEEPPPPPKKABC <br />should be A4B3CXYZE4P5K2ABC. <br />you are supposed to iterate the array only once, and modify the same input parameter, do not create any new string.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>write a function strRemove(char *source, char *remove ) <br />This function will delete all the chars that exist in string remove from array source, number of iteration should be only 1. Make the searching efficient. <br />Example <br />(&quot;amazon development center&quot;, &quot;aenr&quot;) <br />&quot;mzo dvlpmt ct&quot;. <br />Criteria - First parameter should be modified , no need to create an extra string. <br />(Answer - Put the second array in a hash table, like array of 256 chars, to search which are the chars needed to be removed with complexity o(1) )<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>you have two BST , they contain the same amount of elements &quot;N&quot; but there structure is different. how will you cross check that the trees are identical with complexity O(N). Also how will you do the same in case its only Binary tree and not a Binary search tree.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>(written test )Write code to traverse a binary tree and save all the elements found in a sorted order in double link list.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>You have a table which contains huge data may be crores of records and a cache which can contain only 1000 records. Query is done on the basis of some unique ID. When any query happens data should be copied to the cache, but the records which are used least amount of time should be removed and should be occupied with newly added records from table. <br />Cache should provide two mechanism , search for record(s) on the basis of a unique id &amp; remove the records which used least amount of time. Cache can contain max 1000 records, and record should be available in cache even after your query is done. So records in cache is refreshed only when new query is done and new record arrives which do not exist in the cache.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>A news paper agency wants an application through which customers can select the news paper &amp; magzenes they need on daily basis (ex day1 -&gt; he need paper1 ,paper2, magjene1, day2 -&gt; none , day3 - paper4 ) etc.. how registration and billing will be done, Provide a high &amp; low level diagrams for it. which are the classes needed for the same.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Two chess players want to play chess online with each other using facebook. Which are the classes you need for it and what are the APIs needed for the same. How one user will inform other once he made a move from his side .(Client server architecture .) . How a client will reduce the unwanted number of hits to server 2) once user1 has made a move how user2 will be informed quickly. 3) how the chess board position will be propagated from user1 to user2 with least amount of data . 4) Tell the security measures to make this game efficient (asked what is BUT and how to solve it) .<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>What is containment and aggregation in COM. What happen to the scope of the object been created in both the case, do they die automatically or you need to delete them.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>How will you implement file search facility in windows, so that you will save the search and indexes for future references. Provide the design &amp; tell the classes needed for the same.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>You are given a paragraph , which contain n number of words, you are given m threads. What you need to do is , each thread should print one word and give the control to next thread ... this way each thread will keep on printing one word , in case last thread come, it iwill invoke the first thread ... procedure will repeat until all the words are printed in paragraph. Finally all the thread should exit gracefully. What kind of synchronization will use ? Answer only the logic to implement (not complete code)<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>you have 100 elements from 1 to 100 but my mistake one of those number overlapped another by repeating itself. <br />Ex. in 1----98,99,100 .... 99 overwrite 2 , so the array becomes ... 1,99,3,4,----99,100 .. Array is not in sorted format , how to find the repeating number ?<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Right a program which will perform the following task -&gt; <br />In a binary tree , if a root is greater then the sum of two child nodes , then the new value of same root will be sum of child nodes , else the right // left child should reinit to such a value, so that the sum of the child nodes will be equal to the value of root node. <br />(I asked him the answer , he told u need to do manipulation twice, 1) while parsing the nodes 2)while unwinding i.e. again recheck the values.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Consider a cloak room. It has 3 compartments, small, medium, large <br />1 medium = 2 small <br />1 large = 2 medium = 4 small <br /> <br />Design such a system, ensuring maximum capacity optimization of the compartments. Also, make the required number of moves (in-btw compartments) as minimum as possible. <br /> <br />Write class, functions. Wht functions will u expose.

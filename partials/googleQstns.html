<li>Engineers at Google have decided to call any integer (+ve, -ve or 0) that is divisible by at least one of the single digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7) as Walprimes. Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. <br />Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. <br />Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. <br />Input format: (Read from stdin) <br />The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. <br />Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. <br />Output format: (Write to stdout) <br />Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. <br />Sample testcase: <br />Input: <br />2 <br />011 <br />12345 <br />Output: <br />6 <br />64 <br />Explanation: <br />For the first test case, s = &quot;011&quot;. There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. <br />Constraints: <br />There are 3 data sets. <br />For the first data set (5 points) - <br />1 <br />For the second data set (10 points) - <br />1 <br />For the third data set (15 points) - <br />1<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Given a binary representation of an integer say 15 as 1111, find the maximum longest continous sequence of 0s. The twist is it needs to be done in log N. I could think of O(N) solution. but couldn't go for log(N). <br /> <br />For example. 10000101 <br />the answer should be 4, because there are 4 continouos zeroes.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>4 individual numbers which could be permuted in 4 factorial ways. permutation of these 4 integers is an 0indexedarray consisting of 4 digits in some order when integers are different. the best permute of the 4 integers is by the following funciton func(summ) = abs(summ[0] - summ[1]) + abs(summ[1] - summ[2] + abs(summ[2] - summ[3])) that would give maximum value. <br /> <br />method signature <br />public int answer(int w, int x, int y, int z){ <br /> <br />} <br /> <br />w = 5 <br />x = 3 <br />y = -1 <br />z = 5 <br /> <br />the sample permute wiht given numbers in the given function that would give maximum value is as follows. <br /> <br />for the <br />summ[0] = 5 <br />summ[1] = -1 <br />summ[2] = 5 <br />summ[3] = 3 <br /> <br />This should be done in O(1)time ans space complexity.

As for how to compute the cost of moving one group to another point, please see the following example. <br /> <br />Group1: (0, 1), 4 <br /> <br />Group2: (1, 3), 3 <br /> <br />Group3: (2, 0), 5 <br /> <br />. 4 . . <br /> <br />. . . 3 <br /> <br />5 . . . <br /> <br />If all of these three groups moving to (1, 1), the cost is: 4*((1-0)+(1-1)) + 5*((2-1)+(1-0))+3*((1-1)+(3-1)) <br /> <br />My idea is : <br /> <br />Firstly, this two dimensional problem can be reduced to two one dimensional problem. In the one dimensional problem, I can prove that the best spot must be one of these groups. In this way, I can give a O(G^2) algorithm.(G is the number of group). <br /> <br />Use iterator's example for illustration: <br /> <br />{(-100,0,100),(100,0,100),(0,1,1)},(x,y,population) <br /> <br />for x, {(-100,100),(100,100),(0,1)}, 0 is the best. <br /> <br />for y, {(0,100),(0,100),(1,1)}, 0 is the best. <br /> <br />So it's (0, 0) <br /> <br />Is there any better solution for this problem. <br /> <br />Thanks,<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>I have two methods of an object, and they each access a critical section of code. I want to restrict access to the section so that in one method, I allow multiple threads to access the critical section. In the other method, I want only one thread to have access. If a caller calls the second method, it should lock out all clients from accessing the critical section in either of the two functions. Here is the basic structure of the class: <br /> <br />class ClassThatNeedsFixing <br />{ <br />public: <br /> // Will allow many concurrent threads through, unless there is a <br /> // call to the other method. <br /> void AllowMany() { <br /> // Here is the critical section that must be protected <br /> ... <br /> } <br /> // Will lock out any client, including callers to the other method. <br /> void AllowOne() { <br /> // Here is the critical section that must be protected <br /> ... <br /> } <br /> private: <br /> // Assume there are members here that need protecting <br /> // above. <br /> ... <br />}; <br />In order to solve this problem, you are provided with two classes: Mutex and Semaphore. They have the standard behavior of the concepts that share their class names. Here are the public interfaces for each of these classes: <br />class Mutex <br />{ <br />public: <br /> Mutex(); <br /> void Acquire(); <br /> void Release(); <br />}; <br />class Semaphore <br />{ <br />public: <br /> // At it's creation, one can specify the count <br /> // of the semaphore. <br /> Semaphore(unsigned int count); <br /> void Acquire(); <br /> void Release(); <br />}; <br /> <br />Fix the ClassThatNeedsFixing implementation so that the critical section is protected. <br /> <br />Your solution will be graded on flexibility and robustness (i.e., we should be able to re-use your solution in a generic case and it should be exception safe). You are allowed to create as many classes/objects/templates/etc that you need. Feel free to use the STL if necessary. Document your code as you would for real-world maintainability.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

We say that k-th disc and j-th disc intersect, if $k\not =j$ and k-th and j-th discs have at least one common point. <br /> <br />Write a function <br /> <br />class Solution { public int number_of_disc_intersections(int[] A); } <br /> <br />which given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and <br /> <br /> <br />\begin{displaymath}A[0]=1 A[1]=5 A[2]=2 A[3]=1 A[4]=4 A[5]=0\end{displaymath} <br /> <br />there are 11 pairs of intersecting discs: <br /> <br /> 0th and 1st <br /> 0th and 2nd <br /> 0th and 4th <br /> 1st and 2nd <br /> 1st and 3rd <br /> 1st and 4th <br /> 1st and 5th <br /> 2nd and 3rd <br /> 2nd and 4th <br /> 3rd and 4th <br /> 4th and 5th <br /> <br />so the function should return 11. <br /> <br />The function should return -1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000. The function may assume that N does not exceed 10,000,000.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

But effectively, one of the area PAB, PBC, PAC is 0 (so just make sure you check that). <br /> <br />if P is outside, the above equality does NOT hold.. <br /> <br />But how you will approach for if point lie outside the triangle<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>A rooted binary tree with keys in its nodes has the binary search tree <br />property (BST property) if, for every node, the keys in its left <br />subtree are smaller than its own key, and the keys in its right <br />subtree are larger than its own key.

<li>The following is one tricky interview practice question. <br /> <br />A non-negative integer is called heavy if the average value of its digits in decimal representation exceeds 7. Assume that 0 has average value of its digits equal to 0. <br /> <br />For example the number 8698 is heavy, because the average value of its digits equal to (8+6+9+8)/4 = 7.75. The number 53141 has the average value of its digits equal to (5+3+1+4+1)/5 = 2.6, so it is not heavy. <br /> <br />Write a function (in C / C++) <br /> <br />int heavy_decimal_count(int a,int b); <br /> <br />that given two non-negative integers a and b returns the number of heavy integers in the interval [a..b] (both ends included). <br /> <br />For example, given a=8675 and b=8689, the integers in the interval are: <br /> <br />8675 avg=6.5 <br />8676 avg=6.75 <br />8677 avg=7 <br />8678 avg=7.25 HEAVY <br />8679 avg=7.5 HEAVY <br />8680 avg=5.5 <br />8681 avg=5.75 <br />8682 avg=6 <br />8683 avg=6.25 <br />8684 avg=6.5 <br />8685 avg=6.75 <br />8686 avg=7 <br />8687 avg=7.25 HEAVY <br />8688 avg=7.5 HEAVY <br />8689 avg=7.75 HEAVY <br /> <br />Five of them are heavy, so the function should return 5. <br /> <br />The function may assume that neither a, nor b exceeds 200,000,000. Of course a solution with complexity of O (nsquare) comes to mind immediately, and 100% it will work. However I will get a timeout error if I am using that solution, as it will be slow. <br />Is there any smart way to solve this?<span class="chevron"></span></li>

Assume that the array is 5,1,3,2,6,8,4,6, and the window size is 3 <br />You should give me 1,1,2,2,4,4. How will you give it?<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>You are given N blocks of height 1…N. In how many ways can you arrange these blocks in a row such that when viewed from left you see only L blocks (rest are hidden by taller blocks) and when seen from right you see only R blocks? Example given N=3, L=2, R=1 there is only one arrangement {2, 1, 3} while for N=3, L=2, R=2 there are two ways {1, 3, 2} and {2, 3, 1}.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Each leaf node has a boolean value associated with it, 1 or 0. In addition, each interior node has either an &quot;AND&quot; or an &quot;OR&quot; gate associated with it. The value of an &quot;AND&quot; gate node is given by the logical AND of its two children's values. The value of an &quot;OR&quot; gate likewise is given by the logical OR of its two children's values. The value of all of the leaf nodes will be given as input so that the value of all nodes can be calculated up the tree. <br />It's easy to find the actual value at the root using level order traversal and a stack(internal if used recursion). <br /> <br />Given V as the desired result i.e we want the value calculated at the root to be V(0 or 1) what is the minimum number of gates flip i.e. AND to OR or OR to AND be required at internal nodes to achieve that? <br /> <br />Also for each internal node you have boolean associated which tells whether the node can be flipped or not. You are not supposed to flip a non flippable internal node.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>This Question was asked in written round on one of the online coding round, The Question was to code this. Question is as follows. <br /> <br />You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements. <br /> <br /> You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones. <br /> <br /> You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff. <br /> <br />You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff. <br /> <br />The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example: <br /> <br /> 41111921111119 <br /> 11119 11119 <br /> <br />If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff. <br /> <br />Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211 <br /> <br />Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4 <br /> <br />This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5. <br /> <br />Here is an example problem: <br /> <br />131251141231 ---- ---- <br /> <br />If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231 <br /> <br />Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5 <br /> <br />This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is <br /> <br />0 8 4 <br /> <br />Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Write a program to sum two binary numbers represented as strings. <br /> <br />Input: &quot;110&quot;, &quot;01101&quot; <br />Output: &quot;10011&quot; <br /> <br />Method signature: <br />public String addBinaryNumbers(String num1, String num2);<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>As input, you are given two sets: <br />1) set R of n1 non-overlapping rectangles, whose sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes (ie: not rotated rectangles). Each rectangle denoted by bottom left &amp; top right corner coordinates. <br />2) set P of n2 points <br />- let n = n1 + n2 <br /> <br />For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set. <br /> <br />Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time. <br /> <br />Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of &quot;&lt;&quot; vs &quot;&lt;=&quot;, etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&amp;C algorithm showed the logic. <br /> <br />Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>McDonald’s sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets. Thus, it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets, since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets, one has to find non-negative integer values of a, b, and c such that <br />6a+9b+20c=n <br />Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False. Hint: use a guess and check approach.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Mastermind is a game of two players. In the beginning, first player decides a secret key, which is a sequence (s1,s2,...sk) where 0 &lt; si &lt;= n, Then second player makes guesses in rounds, where each guess is of form (g1,g2, ...gk), and after each guess first player calculates the score for the guess. Score for a guess is equal to number of i's for which we have gi = si. <br /> <br />For example if the secret key is (4,2,5,3,1) and the guess is (1,2,3,7,1),then the score is 2, because <br />g2 = s2 and g5 = s5. <br /> <br />Given a sequence of guesses, and scores for each guess, your program must decide if there exists at least one secret key that generates those exact scores. <br /> <br />Input <br /> <br />First line of input contains a single integer C (1 &lt;=C &lt;= 100). C test-cases follow. First line of each test-case contains three integers n,k and q. (1 &lt;=n,k &lt;=11, 1&lt;=q&lt;=8). Next q lines contain the guesses. <br /> <br />Each guess consists of k integers gi,1, gi,2,....gi,k separated by a single space, followed by the score for the guess bi (1 &lt;= gi,j&lt;=n for all 1 &lt;=i &lt;=q, 1 &lt;=j &lt;=k; and 0 &lt;= bi &lt;=k ) <br /> <br />Output <br /> <br />For each test-case, output &quot;Yes&quot; (without quotes), if there exists at least a secret key which generates those exact scores, otherwise output &quot;No&quot;. <br /> <br />Sample Input <br />2 <br /> <br />4 4 2 <br />2 1 2 2 0 <br />2 2 1 1 1 <br />4 4 2 <br />1 2 3 4 4 <br />4 3 2 1 1 <br /> <br />Sample Output <br /> <br />Yes <br />No<span class="chevron"></span></li>

There are N discs which have radius 1 to N; Given the initial configuration of the pegs and the final configuration of the pegs, output the moves required to transform from the initial to final configuration. You are required to do the transformations in minimal number of moves. <br /> <br /> A move consists of picking the topmost disc of any one of the pegs and placing it on top of anyother peg. <br /> At anypoint of time, the decreasing radius property of all the pegs must be maintained. <br /> <br /> <br />Constraints: <br />1&lt;= N&lt;=8 <br />3&lt;= K&lt;=5 <br /> <br /> <br />Input Format: <br />N K <br />2nd line contains N integers. <br />Each integer in the second line is in the range 1 to K where the i-th integer denotes the peg to which disc of radius i is present in the initial configuration. <br />3rd line denotes the final configuration in a format similar to the initial configuration. <br /> <br /> <br />Output Format: <br />The first line contains M - The minimal number of moves required to complete the transformation. <br />The following M lines describe a move, by a peg number to pick from and a peg number to place on. <br />If there are more than one solutions, it's sufficient to output any one of them.

<li>Suppose you have a graph G(V,E). <br />You are supposed to find the shortest path from a vertex 's' to vertex 'e' for 'n' different cases. <br /> <br />In each case one of the edges 'Ei' (any one edge) of the graph will be blocked/deleted only for that case and we have to find the shortest path in the graph with that edge removed. <br /> <br />Guys finding the shortest path is easy. But how can I make the algo so fast that even if I remove one of the edges my algo should still be very fast. O(n log n) or faster. <br />Remember we are not deleting the edges permanently. We are just temporary removing one edge per case. <br />In each case only one edge is removed. <br />Suppose we blocked one edge E in one case. We have to find the shortest path for the graph. <br />In next case, we will reconnect the last edge and we will block/remove a new edge. And again for this new case we have to find the shortest path. <br /> <br />Another way of understanding the problem is suppose there are cities connected to each other. <br />And every day one of the roads gets blocked because of heavy rain. what is the shortest path every day from city s to e. <br />Also one more important thing to note that each road can be used only once. <br />But there could be more than 1 direct road from city a to city b. <br /> <br />FInd the shortest path distance from city s to e on a day when all direct roads from city f to city h are blocked.

It is easy to see that not all such strings represent valid RPN expressions. For example, the &quot;x*x&quot; is not a valid RPN expression, while &quot;xx*&quot; and &quot;xxx**&quot; are valid expressions. What is the minimum number of insert, delete and replace operations needed to convert the given string into a valid RPN expression? <br /> <br />Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T.

For example, if 'a' and 'c' are adjacent, they can replaced with 'b'. What is the smallest string which can result by applying this operation repeatedly? <br /> <br />Input: <br />The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains the string you start with. <br /> <br />Output: <br />Output T lines, one for each test case containing the smallest length of the resultant string after applying the operations optimally. <br /> <br />Constraints: <br />1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100 <br />The string will have at most 100 characters. <br /> <br />Sample Input: <br />3 <br />cab <br />bcab <br />ccccc <br /> <br />Sample Output: <br />2 <br />1 <br />5 <br /> <br />Explanation: <br />For the first case, you can either get cab -&gt; cc or cab -&gt; bb, resulting in a string of length 2. <br />For the second case, one optimal solution is: bcab -&gt; aab -&gt; ac -&gt; b. No more operations can be applied and the resultant string has length 1. <br />For the third case, no operations can be performed and so the answer is 5.<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>You have a room-full of balances and weights. Each balance weighs ten pounds and is <br /> considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are <br /> exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed <br /> some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged <br /> and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances <br />so that they are all perfectly balanced. <br /> <br />There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances. <br /> <br />The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. <br />Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... <br />Each pair of lines is formatted as follows: <br /> <br />WL &lt;balances&gt; <br />WR &lt;balances&gt; <br /> <br />WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively. <br /> &lt;balances&gt; is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance. <br /> &lt;balances&gt; may contain zero or more elements. <br /> <br />Consider the following input: <br /> <br />4 <br />0 1 <br />0 2 <br />0 <br />0 3 <br />3 <br />0 <br />0 <br />0 <br /> <br />Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side and balance 2 on its right side <br />Balance 1 has balance 3 on its right side <br />Balance 2 has three pounds on its left side <br />Balance 3 has nothing on it <br /> <br />Since balance 3 has nothing on it it is already perfectly balanced, and weighs a total of 10 pounds. <br />Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. <br />Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. <br />Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side. <br /> <br />The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows: <br /> <br />&lt;index&gt;: &lt;weight added to left side&gt; &lt;weight added to right side&gt; <br /> <br />So the output for this problem would be: <br /> <br />0: 0 14 <br />1: 10 0 <br />2: 0 3 <br />3: 0 0<span class="chevron"></span></li>

(if some positions cause others to be invalid, choose the positions that allow the most words to be placed.) <br /> <br />Words can read across, backwards (right to left), down, and up. <br />A word is two or more characters in a row. <br />Positions are not valid if they cause non-words to appear in the grid. <br />If a word could fit in either direction (across/backwards) (up/down) choose across or down. <br /> <br />the question <br /> <br /> <br />example input: <br />alley <br />zebra <br />bole <br />bolero <br />wares <br />forgetmenot <br />carbonate <br />aardvarks <br />trombone <br />arts <br />example output: <br />alley c <br />r l s f aardvarks <br />b orelob r <br />elob r r b s <br />z r a g enobmort <br /> seraw e t n r <br /> l t a aardvarks <br /> forgetmenot <br /> b t e o e <br /> a n b <br /> n o r <br />enobmort aardvarks <br /> b c <br /> r <br />aardvarks <br /> c<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Find Sophie <br />After a long day of coding, you love to head home and relax with a loved one. Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie. <br /> <br />Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Input Specifications <br /> The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity): <br /> &lt;location name&gt; &lt;probability&gt;probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there. <br /> <br />The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form: <br /> &lt;location name&gt; &lt;location name&gt; &lt;seconds&gt; The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file. <br /> <br />Example input file: <br />4 <br />front_door .2 <br />in_cabinet .3 <br />under_bed .4 <br />behind_blinds .1 <br />5 <br />front_door under_bed 5 <br />under_bed behind_blinds 9 <br />front_door behind_blinds 5 <br />front_door in_cabinet 2 <br />in_cabinet behind_blinds 6 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Output Specifications <br /> Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print &quot;-1.00&quot; followed by a newline instead. <br /> <br />Example output: <br />6.00<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Gattaca <br />You have a DNA string that you wish to analyze. Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of &quot;gene predictions&quot;, each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Input Specification <br /> Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows. <br /> <br />The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given. <br /> <br />The next ceiling(n / 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand. <br /> <br />The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given. <br /> <br />The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form <br /> &lt;start&gt; &lt;stop&gt; &lt;score&gt; representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1). <br /> <br />Example Input: <br />100 <br />GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT <br />CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG <br />8 <br />43 70 27 <br />3 18 24 <br />65 99 45 <br />20 39 26 <br />45 74 26 <br />10 28 20 <br />78 97 23 <br />0 9 22 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Output Specification <br /> Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline. The total score is simply the sum of the scores of the gene predictions included in your final result. <br /> <br />When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input. If you find the contents of a gene replicated elsewhere in the DNA string, you are not allowed to treat the second copy as a viable gene. Your solution must be fast and efficient to be considered correct by the robot. <br /> <br />Example Output: <br />100<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>It's A Small World <br />As a popular engineer, you know many people in your home city. While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting. <br /> <br />Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170. <br /> <br />Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Input specifications <br /> The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line. <br /> <br />Example input file: <br />1 0.0 0.0 <br />2 10.1 -10.1 <br />3 -12.2 12.2 <br />4 38.3 38.3 <br />5 79.99 179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Output specifications <br /> In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last. <br /> <br />Example output: <br />1 2,3,4 <br />2 1,3,4 <br />3 1,2,4 <br />4 1,2,3 <br />5 4,3,1<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Really like the linear solution of this problem. You have an array of 0s and 1s and you want to output all the intervals (i, j) where the number of 0s and numbers of 1s are equal. <br /> <br />Example <br /> <br />pos = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <br /> 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 <br /> <br />One interval is (0, 1) because there the number of 0 and 1 are equal.

<li>So the Problem being this. <br />Given a particular number say 637-8687 (NERVOUS) would be the word. <br />So for the older keypad’s seen on telephone’s I would have to create Mnemonics. <br /> <br />So for doing this, the first part being list out all the Permutations possible for a particular number series. <br /> <br />Ex: ListMnemonics(“723?) would result in <br />PAD PBD PCD QAD QBD QCD RAD RBD RCD SAD SBD SCD <br />PAE PBE PCE QAE QBE QCE RAE RBE RCE SAE SBE SCE <br />PAF PBF PCF QAF QBF QCF RAF RBF RCF SAF SBF SCF <br /> <br />For this my logic is <br />for the above number 723, somehow create all the permutations for 23 and then append for each of those permutations the letters of 7. That would give all the permutations possible for 723. The base case being if there is a single number then I would print its letters. <br /> <br />But please let me know what you guys think<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Input a string and a pattern having . and * <br />Output: whether the string fully matches the pattern <br />. match any char, * means matching 0 or more times. <br />Example: <br />input &quot;a&quot;, &quot;.&quot; =&gt; match <br />input &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;.*&quot; =&gt; match <br />input &quot;abcd&quot;, &quot;a.*d&quot; =&gt; match<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Input: <br />Either an object array having integer, string and boolean, like <br />{&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ab,c&quot;, 10, true, false} <br />Or a hash table like <br />{&quot;a1&quot;:&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;t&quot;:true,&quot;e&quot;:123} <br /> <br />Output: <br />If object array, output <br />&quot;abc&quot; <br />10 <br />true <br /> <br />If hash, output <br />&quot;a1&quot;:&quot;abc&quot; <br />&quot;t&quot; : true <br />&quot;e&quot; : 123<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>You bought a carpet of size n*n, and when you got home you found it has white spots, and black spots (You don't know if it's a white carper with black spots, or a black carpet with white spots). A spot is one or more of the n*n 'cells', or the same color, with either a common side or a common corner. The 'original color' is that of which there are more spots. <br />for example: <br />- if the carpet is all white, with a black circle in the middle, it's either black or white (as there is one white spot and one black spot) <br />- if the carpet is all white with a black, side to side, stripe in the middle, the carpet is white (as there are two whites, and one black spot) <br />- if it's a 'chessboard' pattern, it's again 1:1 (as each white has a common corner with another white...) <br /> <br />write a function: <br /> <br />int getOriginalColor(boolean[][]) <br /> <br />that would return 0 for white, 1 for black, 2 for tie<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Say you need to design a web application which needs to support friends of <br />friends function(like in linked in, when you search a person, it will show <br />you if this person is linked with you, your connection or your connections' <br />conection...), we expect to have millions of users and each user may have <br />thousands of friends, how would you design/implement this function to make <br />it scalable.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Design Farmville, <br /> <br />Consider only crops and animals for now. <br /> <br />Whats classes will you have? <br />How will you handle interactions between various objects? <br />What design patterns can you use? <br /> <br />How will you handle millions of users?<span class="chevron"></span></li>

<li>Take a tree (binary or otherwise), write a method in any language that, when given the root node, will print out the tree in level order. With a new line after the end of every level. <br /> <br />Helper methods are ok, big O run time efficiency doesn't matter (though obviously a quicker solution is better). Do not destroy original tree.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Write code for finding length of largest monotonically increasing sequence in an array of integers. <br />Optimize it (not the usual O(n) in worst case, but a better approach in average case).<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Write a program to find the square root of a given number. <br /> <br />He wanted some kind of binary search.<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>Has anyone tried this? http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=11 <br /> <br />The brute force way is n! so definitely won't scale. I tried a little bit of pruning (where I keep track of expected time and as soon as I see that it's more than then current minimum expected time, I bail out). But other than that, can't think of any.. <br /> <br />So here is I have uptill now: <br />for all permutations of possible paths: <br /> find expected time for that shortest path <br /> if (there is a path) and (expected time &lt; min expected time) <br /> minexpectedtime = expectedtime. <br /> <br />Can someone give me hints on pruning? I think I need a better way than going through all the permutations but am unable to think? Any help on algorithms/pruning/datastructure would be appreciated..<span class="chevron"></span></li>
<li>User Bin Crash <br /> <br />You are on a cargo plane full of commercial goods when the pilot announces that the plane is short on fuel. Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations. <br /> <br />Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer. <br /> <br /> <br />Input specifications <br /> <br />The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is: <br />&lt;SKU label&gt; &lt;weight in pounds&gt; &lt;cost in dollars&gt; <br />SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files. <br /> <br />Example input file: <br />1250 <br />LJS93K 1300 10500 <br />J38ZZ9 700 4750 <br />HJ394L 200 3250 <br />O1IE82 75 10250 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Output specifications <br /> <br />Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar signs. <br /> <br />Example output (newline after integer): <br />9500<span class="chevron"></span></li>
